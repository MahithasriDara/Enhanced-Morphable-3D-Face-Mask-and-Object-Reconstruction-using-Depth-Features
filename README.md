# Enhanced-Morphable-3D-Face-Mask-and-Object-Reconstruction-using-Depth-Features

This repository contains the implementation for the final year project titled **"Enhanced Morphable 3D Face and Object Reconstruction using Depth Features"**. The project focuses on generating accurate and editable 3D face and object models from a single 2D image using landmark detection, depth feature extraction, and edge enhancement techniques.

## üìå Project Description

Traditional 3D reconstruction methods often require multiple images or depth sensors, which are costly and computationally intensive. This project uses deep learning methods to reconstruct 3D models from a single 2D image by integrating:

- 2D to 3D landmark mapping
- Depth feature extraction
- Edge detection for mesh refinement
- 3D mesh generation and export

The final output is an editable 3D mesh model that can be exported in formats such as `.obj` or `.ply`.

## üèóÔ∏è Methodology Overview

### ‚û§ Input: 2D Image  
### ‚û§ Steps:
1. **Preprocessing:** Resize and normalize the input image.
2. **Face Detection:** Check if the image contains a face.
3. **Landmark Extraction:** Use 468-point detection for improved mesh accuracy.
4. **Depth and Edge Extraction:** Extract and enhance depth and edge features.
5. **3D Mesh Generation:** Fuse features into a 3D mesh using morphable models.
6. **Export:** Save the mesh in editable format.
